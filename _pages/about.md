<section class="about">
<p>Something has to be said about being in the development world. You can find so many resources about syntax or a specific error message, but it's not as much about everything outside of the code.</p>
<p>You might find something about imposter syndrome, but not about having your own mantra. Also, what if you were looking for words of encouragement? Where do you go from there?</p>
<p>This is where "Live with Code" comes into play. I know this isn't going to be the all-to guide for encouragement, but just a unique spin from a web developer/rubber duck/ instructor associate who spends much of her time encouraging other devs. </p>

<h3>So welcome!</h3>
